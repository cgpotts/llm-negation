\section{Background}

Sam Bowman wrote a blog post that included this claim:
%
\begin{quote}
  It's still easy to find extremely strong negative claims about these
  models from serious researchers, such as that LLMs don't have the
  capacity to handle negation (i.e., that they wonâ€™t be appropriately
  sensitive to it even in typical cases that look like language model
  training data). Ten minutes of interaction with the OpenAI API
  sandbox should be sufficient to refute this, but the academic
  conversation often anchors primarily on older systems or on smaller
  systems that are practical to run on academic clusters.

  \url{https://wp.nyu.edu/arg/why-ai-safety/} (October 6, 2022;
  updated October 8, 2022)
\end{quote}
%
On my reading, this is a claim that the best OpenAI models as of this
writing make correct predictions about simple cases involving
negation, and that this is self-evident from basic interactions with
these models.

If this is true, then it is a major discovery and a significant sign
of progress. If it is incorrect, then it raises real concerns for me
as someone who cares about this topic. Bowman is very influential, and
statements like this can shape people's attitudes about what it is
worthwhile to work on.

No evidence is provided in the above post. Free-form interaction with
the API is very unlikely to lead to reliable evidence, since it is
unlikely to involve systematic exploration of a wide range of cases
with careful, predefined criteria for success. In general, free-form
interaction leaves one susceptible to confirmation bias.

In this document, I report on my own investigations. The high-level
summary is that in a balanced test set of 200 diverse sentences
involving basic interactions of negation with lexical entailment
relations, the best I was able to do was 62\% accuracy (chance is
50\%).

It may be that there are prompting strategies that will yield better
results, but I do not think it is trivial to find them, and so I think
this actually challenges Bowman's characterization above. It may be
that Bowman agrees with this fundamental point, since the following
thread asserts that the desired behavior can be elicited with very
careful methods (which are not disclosed in the thread as of this
writing):

\section{Dataset structure}

This dataset was created by Selena She and Atticus Geiger this past
summer. It extends \href{https://github.com/atticusg/MoNLI}{the MoNLI
  dataset} with lots of different kinds of negated example.

\section{Methods}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Engine: \texttt{text-davinci-002}
\item The experimental runs given below were conducted on October 9, 2022.
\item Temperature: 0.0
\item Per-split distribution:

\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
 &  entailment &  neutral \\
\midrule
both not scoping     &          25 &       25 \\
one not scoping      &          25 &       25 \\
one scoping          &          25 &       25 \\
one scoping, one not &          25 &       25 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\item Label inference: If the response contains ``yes'' (case-insensitive),
  then we infer the label \texttt{entailment}, else we infer
  \texttt{neutral}.

\item Across experiments, the only thing that varies is the nature of
  the prompt function.

\item Below, I've indicated all actual newlines with
  {\color{gray}\textbackslash n}. The newlines in
  the latex formatting are just to make them intuitive to read.

\subsection{Reasoning Prompt Error Analysis}

The reasoning prompt responses might provide some insights into how
systematic the model's behavior actually is. Some observations:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item For premise \word{The man is not allergic to any snakes} and
  hypothesis \word{The man is not allergic to any pythons} (an
  entailment
  case), the model continues from ``The premise basically tells us
  that'' with

  \texttt{the man has no allergies to snakes in general. That doesn't
    mean that he can't be allergic to a specific type of snake, such
    as a python. So the answer is No, we cannot logically conclude for
    sure that the man is not allergic to any pythons.}

  A charitable interpretation is that it has interpreted the \word{any}
  forms as generics. This explains a lot of the mistakes it makes
  in these simple negation cases.

\item Relatedly, some things labeled mistakes seems defensible. For
  example, for
  premise  \word{The woman liked corn, not exercise.} and hypothesis
  \word{The woman liked food, not exercise.} (an entailment case), the
  model continues from ``The premise basically tells us that'' with

  \texttt{the woman liked corn, not exercise. We can't assume that she
    liked food just because she liked corn. She might just have a
    specific taste for corn. We can't logically conclude that she
    liked food, not exercise.\mynewline
    Answer: No}

  This can be read as reflecting how unstable reasoning is with
  generics.

\item Very often, the model seems to get lost as it reasons,
  leading to a jumble of reasoning steps that do not form a coherent
  argument. For example, for premise \word{The people not wearing blue
    are not playing instruments}
  and hypothesis \word{The people not wearing blue are not playing
    tambourines.} (an entailment case), the model continues from ``The
  premise basically tells us that'' with

  \texttt{there are two groups of people- those not wearing blue and those
  playing instruments. It's possible that there are people who are not
  wearing blue and are playing instruments, but we can't say for sure.
  It's also possible that there are people who are not wearing blue
  and are not playing instruments. We can't say for sure that the
  people not wearing blue are not playing tambourines, but it's more
  likely than the alternative.\mynewline
  Answer: No}

\item I was struck by the fact that the model caught one kind of case
  that shouldn't be in our dataset. For premise \word{The boy can find
    a turtle, just not now.} and hypothesis \word{The boy can find a
    reptile, just not now.}, we assign the label entailment. However,
  the model tends to give answers that convey neutral, with the
  reasoning that \word{just not now} has created a non-monotonic
  reasoning environment.

\item Sometimes it seems like the model is simply reasoning
  incorrectly about exactly what we care about.
  For example, for premise \word{A woman liked food, not exercise}
  and hypothesis \word{A woman liked pudding, not exercise},
  the model continues from ``The
  premise basically tells us that'' with

  \texttt{the woman liked food and not exercise. So, we can logically
    conclude that she liked pudding and not exercise.\mynewline
    Answer: Yes}
